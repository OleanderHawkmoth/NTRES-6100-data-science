## Readings

#### Required:

If you didn't have a chance to read it yet, have a look at [Chapter 21 in 'R for Data Science'](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund


<br>

#### Other resources:
We will be working through [this tutorial](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/programming.html) developed by the Ocean Health Index Data Science Team

<br>
<br>


## Today's learning objectives

By the end of today's class, you should be able to:

* Write a `for` loop to repeat operations on different input
* Implement `if` and `if else` statements for conditional execution of code

<br>
