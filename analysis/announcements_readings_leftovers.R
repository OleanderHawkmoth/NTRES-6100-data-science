* The final homework is due tonight

* Wednesday is our last class - we're looking forward to your presentations. To make sure we hear from everybody, we'll have to stick to a strict 1.5 min presentation per participant. Please get concrete and show us some examples of the types of data you work with or the types of computational/analytical challenges you're confronted with in your work

* If you can't give a live presentation, please upload your video on [Canvas through this link](https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/21578/assignments/174563) by this Wednesday (Nov 11) at 10pm









## Quick recap on writing functions 
#### We did not have time to cover this in lecture, but I encourage you to review the tutorial on your own

Last time, we made a function that would save a plot of how a variable of choice changed over time for a specific country in the `gapminder` dataset. Today we'll quickly go over how we use a similar structure to write a function for computing numeric output. We'll do this with Jenny Bryan's example and calculating interquantile range in the gapminder data [here](https://stat545.com/functions-part1.html). We won't have time to cover all the details she illustrates, so if you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend working through the rest of her examples in her chapters 18-21 on your own.

## THE END
This is all we had time to cover in this course. In our final class, we're looking forward to hearing all of your ideas for applying the course material in practice, and we'll go over helpful resources for learning more.
