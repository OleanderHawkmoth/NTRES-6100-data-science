## Data import

### Reading data into RStudio

In lesson 10, we introduced some of the most commonly used `readr` data import functions, such as `read_csv()`, `read_tsv()`, and `read_delim()`. Let's revisit these to import [Jenny Bryan's Lord of the Rings Data](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/01-intro.md) that we've used in several previous lessons. 

We can import directly from Jenny's GitHub page:
```{r}
lotr_tidy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/lotr_tidy.csv")
```

<br>

Or we can use import it from a copy saved on our local computer

```{r}
lotr_tidy <- read_csv("../datasets/lotr_tidy.csv")
```
<br>

`read_csv()` uses the first line of the data for the column names, which is a very common convention. We can play around with tweaking our local copy of the data file to make use of the options for tweaking this behavior. For example, if there are a few lines of metadata at the top of the file, we can use `skip = n` to skip the first n lines; or use `comment = "#"` to drop all lines that start with (e.g.) #. When the data do not have column names, we can use  `col_names = FALSE` to tell `read_csv()` not to treat the first row as headings, and instead label them sequentially from `X1` to `Xn`.

<br>

### Why use the tidyverse/readr import functions instead of base-R?

> From [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#compared-to-base-r)

If you’ve used R before, you might wonder why we’re not using read.csv(). There are a few good reasons to favour readr functions over the base equivalents:

* They are typically much faster (~10x) than their base equivalents. Long running jobs have a progress bar, so you can see what’s happening. If you’re looking for raw speed, try data.table::fread(). It doesn’t fit quite so well into the tidyverse, but it can be quite a bit faster.

* They produce tibbles, they don’t convert character vectors to factors, use row names, or munge the column names. These are common sources of frustration with the base R functions.

* They are more reproducible. Base R functions inherit some behaviour from your operating system and environment variables, so import code that works on your computer might not work on someone else’s.

<br>

### Parsing different data types

As we saw above, when we run `read_csv()`, it prints out a column specification that gives the name and type of each column.

<br>

> The following section is borrowed from [R4DS Chapter 11.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) 

readr uses a heuristic to figure out the type of each column: it reads the first 1000 rows and uses some (moderately conservative) heuristics to figure out the type of each column.

The heuristic tries each of the following types, stopping when it finds a match:

* logical: contains only “F”, “T”, “FALSE”, or “TRUE”.
* integer: contains only numeric characters (and -).
* double: contains only valid doubles (including numbers like 4.5e-5).
* number: contains valid doubles with the grouping mark inside.
* time: matches the default time_format.
* date: matches the default date_format.
* date-time: any ISO8601 date.

If none of these rules apply, then the column will stay as a vector of strings.


Trying the guess the variable type from the first 1000 lines of data works for a majority of datasets. But it doesn't always work for larger data files. There are two basic problems:

* The first thousand rows might be a special case, and readr guesses a type that is not sufficiently general. For example, you might have a column of doubles that only contains integers in the first 1000 rows.

* The column might contain a lot of missing values. If the first 1000 rows contain only NAs, readr will guess that it’s a logical vector, whereas you probably want to parse it as something more specific.

<br>

readr contains a challenging CSV that illustrates both of these problems:

```{r}
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"))

```

<br>

There are two printed outputs: the column specification generated by looking at the first 1000 rows, and the first five parsing failures. It’s always a good idea to explicitly pull out the problems(), so you can explore them in more depth:

```{r}
problems(challenge)
```

<br>

A good strategy is to work column by column until there are no problems remaining. Here we can see that there are a lot of parsing problems with the y column. If we look at the last few rows, you’ll see that they’re dates stored in a character vector.

That suggests we need to use a date parser instead. To fix the call, start by copying and pasting the column specification into your original call:

```{r}
challenge <- read_csv(
  readr_example("challenge.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(
    x = col_double(),
    y = col_logical()
  )
)
```

<br>

Then you can fix the type of the y column by specifying that y is a date column:

```{r}
challenge <- read_csv(
  readr_example("challenge.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(
    x = col_double(),
    y = col_date()
  )
)
tail(challenge)
```

<br>

There are a few other general strategies to help you parse files:

In the previous example, we just got unlucky: if we look at just one more row than the default, we can correctly parse in one shot:

```{r}
challenge2 <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), guess_max = 1001)
```

<br>

You might have noticed that readr needed a little help with variable type parsing when we've been reading in our coronavirus dataset

```{r}
coronavirus <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv')
```

<br>
What is the problem here? 

It will only load properly if we specify that the province column does not contain logicals but is character vector:

```{r}
coronavirus <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv', col_types = cols(province = col_character()))
```


<br>
<br>




### Converting between data types

#### Parsing numbers

It seems like it should be straightforward to parse a number, but three problems make it tricky:

1. People write numbers differently in different parts of the world. For example, some countries use . in between the integer and fractional parts of a real number, while others use ,.

1. Numbers are often surrounded by other characters that provide some context, like “$1000” or “10%”.

1. Numbers often contain “grouping” characters to make them easier to read, like “1,000,000”, and these grouping characters vary around the world.

To address the first problem, readr has the notion of a “locale”, an object that specifies parsing options that differ from place to place. When parsing numbers, the most important option is the character you use for the decimal mark. You can override the default value of . by creating a new locale and setting the decimal_mark argument:

```{r}
parse_double("1.23")
parse_double("1,23", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
```

<br>

readr’s default locale is US-centric, because generally R is US-centric (i.e. the documentation of base R is written in American English). An alternative approach would be to try and guess the defaults from your operating system. This is hard to do well, and, more importantly, makes your code fragile: even if it works on your computer, it might fail when you email it to a colleague in another country.

parse_number() addresses the second problem: it ignores non-numeric characters before and after the number. This is particularly useful for currencies and percentages, but also works to extract numbers embedded in text.

```{r}
parse_number("$100")
parse_number("20%")
parse_number("It cost $123.45")
```

<br>

The final problem is addressed by the combination of parse_number() and the locale as parse_number() will ignore the “grouping mark”:

```{r}
# Used in America
parse_number("$123,456,789")

# Used in many parts of Europe
parse_number("123.456.789", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "."))

# Used in Switzerland
parse_number("123'456'789", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "'"))
```

<br>
<br>

#### Dates

Dates can be tricky! If you work with date data, I suggest you review chapters [11.3.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#readr-datetimes) and [16](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) in R4DS.

<br>
<br>

#### Converting between data types with `parse_x()` functions

We can use the `parse_x()` functions in combination with `mutate()` to clean up values in a variable. Let's have a look at how to clean up this dataset:

```{r}
mess = read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nt246/NTRES6940-data-science/master/datasets/messy_data.tsv", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))

# What happens if we run this without the locale argument?
```

Let's clean up the `price` column

```{r}
mess %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price))
```


<br>
<br>

#### Data export
readr also comes with two useful functions for writing data back to disk: `write_csv()` and `write_tsv()`. Both functions increase the chances of the output file being read back in correctly and also let's you save dataframes with less typing than you often would need to e.g. avoid rownames or quotes with the base-R function `write.table()`

Let's look at an example. Say we wanted to save a summary we had generated a few week ago of the coronavirus data:

```{r}
coronavirus %>%  
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>% 
  write_csv(path = "../datasets/daily_casecount.csv")
```

<br>

We also briefly talked about how to save plots a few classes ago. To recap here:

![Slide from Jenny Bryan's ggplot tutorial https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial/blob/master/ggplot2-tutorial-slides/ggplot2-tutorial-slides.050.png?raw=true)


<br>

Use `ggsave()`

```{r}
coronavirus %>%  
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = total_cases)) +
  geom_line()
  
ggsave(filename = "assets/daily_casecounts_plot.png")

```
